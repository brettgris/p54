	<p>Just a short drive into the mountains surrounding Denver, Colorado is the quaint mountain town of Evergreen. This time of year the leaves on the aspen trees are starting to change to a vibrant yellow and the views are breathtaking. There is also just something about the sky in the mountains, especially in fall. It is so vibrantly blue and so big that it seems to almost overtake the rest of the landscape.</p>

	<p>In true Evergreen fashion, we quickly stumbled upon an entire family of elk on the side of the road. This is one of the best parts about the mountains in Colorado, you never know what wildlife you are going to run into.</p>

	<p>It was an absolutely beautiful day with the crisp autumn air, yet still a bit warm. Everyone was out and about and walking around the path on Evergreen lake or sitting at the picnic tables near the lake house. We stopped by a cute Farmerâ€™s Market on the way out, and took a peek at the pumpkins and palisade peaches. Overall, we had so much fun visiting the adorable town of Evergreen. It is a great place to visit if you are in the Denver area and are looking for a quick trip to the mountains.</p>
